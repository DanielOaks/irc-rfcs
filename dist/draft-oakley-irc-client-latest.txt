                  Internet Relay Chat Client Protocol
                     draft-oakley-irc-client-latest

Abstract

   The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol has been designed over a
   number of years, with multitudes of implementations and use cases
   appearing.  This document describes the IRC Client-Server protocol.

   IRC is a text-based chat protocol which has proven itself valuable
   and useful.  It is well-suited to running on many machines in a
   distributed fashion.  A typical setup involves multiple servers
   connected in a distributed network.  Messages are delivered through
   this network and state is maintained across it for the connected
   clients and active channels.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol has been designed over a
   number of years, with multitudes of implementations and use cases
   appearing.  This document describes the IRC Client-Server protocol.

   IRC is a text-based chat protocol which has proven itself valuable
   and useful.  It is well-suited to running on many machines in a
   distributed fashion.  A typical setup involves multiple servers
   connected in a distributed network.  Messages are delivered through
   this network and state is maintained across it for the connected
   clients and active channels.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  IRC Concepts

   This section describes concepts behind the implementation and
   organisation of the IRC protocol, which are useful in understanding
   how it works.

2.1.  Architectural

   A typical IRC network consists of servers and clients connected to
   those servers, with a good mix of IRC operators and channels.  This
   section goes through each of those, what they are and a brief
   overview of them.

2.1.1.  Servers

   Servers form the backbone of IRC, providing a point to which clients
   may connect and talk to each other, and a point for other servers to
   connect to, forming an IRC network.

   The most common network configuration for IRC servers is that of a
   spanning tree, where each server acts as a central node for the rest
   of the network it sees.  Other topologies are being experimented
   with, but right there are no others widely used in production.

                 Figure 1: Format of a typical IRC network

   There have been several terms created over time to describe the roles
   of different servers on an IRC network.  Some of the most common
   terms are as follows:

   o  *Hub*: A hub is a server that connects to multiple other servers.
      For instance, in the figure above, Server 2, Server 3, and Server
      4 would be examples of hub servers.

   o  *Core Hub*: A core hub is typically a hub server that connects
      fairly major parts of the IRC network together.  What is
      considered a core hub will change depending on the size of a
      network and what the administrators of the network consider
      important.  For instance, in the figure above, Server 1, Server 2,
      and Server 3 may be considered core hubs by the network
      administrators.

   o  *Leaf*: A leaf is a server that is only connected to a single
      other server on the network.  Typically, leafs are the primary
      servers that handle client connections.  In the figure above,
      Servers 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, and others would be considered leaf
      servers.

   o  *Services*: A services server is a special type of server that
      extends the capabilities of the server software on the network
      (ie, they provide _services_ to the network).  Services are not
      used on all networks, and the capabilities typically provided by
      them may be built-into server software itself rather than being
      provided by a separate software package.  Features usually handled
      by services include client account registration (as are typically
      used for SASL authentication), channel registration (allowing
      client accounts to 'own' channels), and further modifications and
      extensions to the IRC protocol.  'Services' themselves are *not*
      specified in any way by the protocol.  What they provide depends
      entirely on the software packages being run.

   A trend these days is to hide the real structure of a network from
   regular users.  Networks that implement this may restrict or modify
   commands like "MAP" so that regular users see every other server on
   the network as linked directly to the current server.  When this is
   done, servers that do not handle client connections may also be
   hidden from users (hubs hidden in this way can be called 'hidden
   hubs').  Generally, IRC operators can always see the true structure
   of a network.

   These terms are not generally used in IRC protocol documentation, but
   may be used by the administrators of a network in order to
   differentiate the servers they run and their roles.
